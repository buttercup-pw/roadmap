## Projects in planning phase

### MyButtercup

**Status:** Research + development

Hosted platform for storing archives and accounts. Other Buttercup software will be able to load and save archives from MyButtercup. Accounts will be free, organisations will be paid (x users or under free - x TBD) (target income model for Buttercup org). Sharing available for organisations.

## Integrations
Tracking of integrated cloud storage providers can be found [here](CLOUD_SERVICES.md).

## Possible/Future projects

### Buttercup self-hosted server

There may be some kind of self-hosted Buttercup _server_, but this depends on how the **MyButtercup** project goes. Priorities are definitely elsewhere currently.
