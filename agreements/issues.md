# Buttercup project issues
Issues created on Buttercup projects should pass some simple rules before being acted upon. These rules are in place to help keep the number of issues down, as many cannot be tackled easily by project members.

## Bugs
New bugs should obey the following rules:

 * They should be reproducible
 * The issue should be clearly identified as being an issue with Buttercup
 * It should not duplicate another issue
 * It should not be a "connection issue" - Bugs can be with connectivity components, but these should be indentified in the issue. Project members simply do not have time to debug all of the connectivity issues.

## Feature requests
New feature requests should obey the following rules:

 * The feature should be reasonable in terms of required effort
 * The feature should align with Buttercup's direction
 * The feature should not make free a paid element of the platform
 * The feature should be well described with steps on how to use it, if it is complex

## Questions
Questions should obey the following rules:

 * No duplicates
 * Relevant to the platform (and project)
