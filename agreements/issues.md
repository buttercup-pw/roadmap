# Buttercup project issues
Issues created on Buttercup projects should pass some simple rules before being acted upon. These rules are in place to help keep the number of issues down, as many cannot be tackled easily by project members.

## New items

### Bugs
New bugs should obey the following rules:

 * They should be reproducible
 * The issue should be clearly identified as being an issue with Buttercup
 * It should not duplicate another issue
 * It should not be a "connection issue" - Bugs can be with connectivity components, but these should be indentified in the issue. Project members simply do not have time to debug all of the connectivity issues.

### Feature requests
New feature requests should obey the following rules:

 * The feature should be reasonable in terms of required effort
 * The feature should align with Buttercup's direction
 * The feature should not make free a paid element of the platform
 * The feature should be well described with steps on how to use it, if it is complex

### Questions
Questions should obey the following rules:

 * No duplicates
 * Relevant to the platform (and project)
 
### General
All issues/PRs should follow these rules:

 * Issue must be relevant for the hardware and software systems that Buttercup is built for. Unsupported OSes/browsers/machines are not valid to lodge issues against.

## Contributing

# How to contribute
First of all, thank you for taking the time to contribute to this project. We've tried to make a stable project and try to fix bugs and add new features continuously. You can help us do more.

Before you start, read the **README.md** file for info on the project and how to set it up.

### Filing issues
Before starting work on a larger idea not discussed in an issue we recommend starting one to iron out your approach to implementation. PRs with conflicting ideas regarding architecture or other aspects of the project may be rejected. We appreciate any and all ideas you contribute providing they're discussed in a respectful and constructive manner.

Issues created that are not relevant to this project will be closed immediately - this is purely for efficiency as we don't have time to address and or move all of them to their correct place.


### Write some code!
Contributing to a project on Github is pretty straight forward. If this is you're first time, there is but one step you should take:

- Fork this repo.

That's it! Read the code available and change the part you don't like! You're change should not break the existing code and should pass the tests.

If you're adding a new functionality, start from the branch **master**. It would be a better practice to create a new branch and work in there.

When you're done, submit a pull request and for one of the maintainers to check it out. We would let you know if there is any problem or any changes that should be considered.

### Tests
We've written tests and you can run them to assure the stability of the code, just try running `npm test`. If you're adding a new functionality please include tests for it.

### Documentation
Every chunk of code that may be hard to understand has some comments above it. If you write some new code or change some part of the existing code in a way that it would not be functional without changing it's usages, it needs to be documented.

### Internationalization / Translations
Translations are very valuable as they make Buttercup accessible to large amounts of people with every submission. They are a little trickier to merge, however, due to the fact that we most likely do not speak the language you're submitting and will need to have it verified by a 3rd party before publishing it.

When submitting a translation: Translate all items from the [English base file](https://github.com/buttercup/buttercup-desktop/blob/master/locales/en/base.json). Do not add English items to any other locale - if something can not yet be translated, omit it from the locale file completely.
